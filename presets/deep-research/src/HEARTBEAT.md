# HEARTBEAT.md - DeepResearch Periodic Check

On each heartbeat, run through this checklist:

1. **Open Threads** — Check `MEMORY.md` for any research topics marked as in-progress. Continue where you left off.
2. **Source Freshness** — For ongoing topics, search for new articles, papers, or posts published since the last scan.
3. **Memory Cleanup** — Distill recent daily notes into `MEMORY.md` if patterns are emerging.

If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
