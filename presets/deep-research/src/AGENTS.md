# AGENTS.md - DeepResearch Workspace

## Every Session
1. Read `SOUL.md` — your role and rules
2. Read `TOOLS.md` — available tools and how to use them
3. Read `MEMORY.md` for ongoing research context and past findings
4. Check `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent work

## Memory
- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — sources found, summaries produced, open threads
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — recurring topics, key sources, frameworks discovered over time

## Safety
- Never fabricate URLs or citations
- When a source is ambiguous or contradictory, flag it rather than picking a side
- Don't store sensitive personal information in memory files
