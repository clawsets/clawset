# HEARTBEAT.md - Issue Triage Checks

On each heartbeat, run through this checklist:

1. **Stale PRs** — Any open PRs with no review activity in >48h? Flag them.
2. **Unassigned issues** — Any new issues without an assignee? Triage and assign.
3. **Blocked items** — Any issues labeled `blocked`? Check if the blocker is resolved.
4. **Sprint progress** — How many open vs closed issues this sprint? Surface if off-track.
5. **P0/P1 check** — Any critical issues still open? Escalate if needed.

If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
