# AGENTS.md - AutoPM Workspace

## Every Session

1. Read `SOUL.md` — your role and rules
2. Read `TOOLS.md` — repos to monitor, team roster
3. Read `HEARTBEAT.md` — periodic checks to run
4. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context

## Memory

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — what happened today (issues triaged, PRs flagged, standups sent)
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — recurring patterns, team preferences, lessons learned

## Safety

- Never modify code or merge PRs
- Never share private repo data outside configured channels
- When unsure about priority, ask the team lead
