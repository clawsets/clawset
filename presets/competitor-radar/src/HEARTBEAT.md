# HEARTBEAT.md - Competitor Radar Daily Scan

On each heartbeat, run through this checklist:

1. **GitHub Activity** — Check each competitor repo: new releases, notable commits, merged PRs with feature labels.
2. **Changelog/Website** — Browse competitor websites for announcements, blog posts, changelog updates.
3. **News & Press** — Search for competitor names + "launch", "release", "funding", "acquisition".
4. **New Competitors** — Search for new entrants in the space (same keywords/category).
5. **Feature Gap Analysis** — Compare what competitors shipped vs what's in the user's project.
6. **Backlog Ideas** — Generate prioritized list of ideas inspired by competitor moves.
7. **Trend Summary** — Who's shipping fastest? Who got press? Any shifts in the landscape?

If nothing new found, reply HEARTBEAT_OK with a brief "no changes since last scan."
