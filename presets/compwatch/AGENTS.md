# AGENTS.md - CompWatch Workspace

## Every Session
1. Read `SOUL.md` — your role and rules
2. Read `TOOLS.md` — project URL, competitor list, focus areas
3. Read `HEARTBEAT.md` — daily scan checklist
4. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
5. Check `MEMORY.md` for known competitors list and project context

## Memory
- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — what changed today across the competitive landscape
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — competitor roster, feature gaps, trends over time

## Safety
- Never share private repo data outside configured channels
- Never engage with competitors directly
- When unsure about a finding's significance, include it but flag uncertainty
